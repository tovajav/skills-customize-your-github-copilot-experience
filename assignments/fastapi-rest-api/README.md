# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to build and test RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework in Python. Practice designing endpoints, handling requests, and returning JSON responses.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️	Create a Simple REST API

#### Description
Write a FastAPI application that exposes basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints for managing a list of items (e.g., books, tasks, or products).

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Use FastAPI to create a web API
- Define endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting items
- Store items in an in-memory Python list or dictionary
- Return responses in JSON format
- Handle errors gracefully (e.g., item not found)

### 🛠️	Test Your API

#### Description
Write example requests using Python (with `requests` library) or a tool like curl/Postman to demonstrate how to interact with your API endpoints.

#### Requirements
Completed program could:

- Include sample code or instructions for testing each endpoint
- Show expected JSON responses
- Demonstrate error handling

### 🛠️	Enhance the API (Optional)

#### Description
Add extra features to make your API more robust or user-friendly.

#### Requirements
Completed program could:

- Add data validation using Pydantic models
- Implement filtering or searching endpoints
- Add authentication or authorization
- Use persistent storage (e.g., SQLite)
