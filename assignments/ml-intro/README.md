# 📘 Assignment: Introduction to Machine Learning with scikit-learn

## 🎯 Objective

Build a simple classifier or regressor using the scikit-learn library. Learn the basics of supervised machine learning, including data preparation, model training, prediction, and evaluation.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️	Build a Classifier or Regressor

#### Description
Use scikit-learn to create a machine learning model that can classify or predict values from a dataset. You may use a provided dataset or find a simple one online (e.g., Iris, Boston Housing, or a CSV of your choice).

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Load a dataset (from scikit-learn or CSV)
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Choose and train a classifier or regressor (e.g., DecisionTree, LogisticRegression, LinearRegression)
- Make predictions on the test set
- Evaluate model performance (accuracy, mean squared error, etc.)

### 🛠️	Experiment and Improve (Optional)

#### Description
Try different models, tune parameters, or visualize results to improve your understanding of machine learning.

#### Requirements
Completed program could:

- Try multiple algorithms and compare results
- Tune hyperparameters (e.g., max_depth, C)
- Visualize predictions vs. actual values
- Write a short reflection on what you learned
